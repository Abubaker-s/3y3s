        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> <strong> What is Machine learning </strong><br> <hr>Machine learnin is a growing technology which enables computers to learn <br>
            automatically from past data. Machine learning uses various algorithms for building <br>
            mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information. <br>
            Currently, it is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech
            recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system, and many
            more</p>
            <p>In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their
                experiences with their learning capability, <br> and we have computers or machines which
                work on our instructions. <br> But can a machine also learn from experiences or past data like
                a human does? <br> So here comes the role of Machine Learning. <br></p>
