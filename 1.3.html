        <h4>Common issues in machine learning</h4>
        <p>Overfitting – The model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to memorizing noise or overly complex patterns.
             <br>Solutions include regularization (L1/L2), dropout (for neural networks), and cross-validation.

             <br>Underfitting – The model is too simple to capture underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and test data.
             <br>Fixes include using more complex models, adding features, or reducing regularization.
            
            <br>Data Quality Issues – Problems like missing values, noise, outliers, and imbalanced datasets can degrade model performance. Techniques like imputation, outlier removal, 
            <br>and resampling (SMOTE for imbalance) help mitigate these issues.
            
            <br>Bias-Variance Tradeoff – High bias (oversimplification) leads to underfitting, while high variance (overcomplexity) leads to overfitting.
             <br>Balancing this tradeoff is crucial for generalization.
            
            <br>Feature Selection & Engineering – Irrelevant or redundant features can reduce model efficiency. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) and feature importance analysis help improve performance</p>
