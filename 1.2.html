        <p> <strong> What is Fundamental of Machine learning </strong><br> <hr>

            Machine learning (ML) is built on several core fundamentals that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. The process begins with 
            <br>**data**, which serves as the foundationâ€”raw information is processed into meaningful **features** and **labels** for training models. 
            <br>**Algorithms**, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks,
             <br>form the backbone of ML by identifying patterns in the data. The **training phase** 
             <br>involves adjusting model parameters to minimize errors, often using optimization techniques like 
            <br> **gradient descent** and **loss functions** to measure performance. After training, models are **evaluated** 
            <br> using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure they generalize well to unseen data. 
            <br> A critical challenge is balancing the **bias-variance tradeoff** to prevent 
            <br> **overfitting** (memorizing training data) or **underfitting** (failing to learn patterns). Finally, 
            <br> **optimization** techniques, including hyperparameter tuning and regularization, refine models for better performance. 
            <br> Together, these principles enable ML systems to adapt and improve over time.
